##Synopsis

<!-- 
##Code Example

##Motivation
To improve the lives of Atlanta's disabled by making transit simpler and more predictable.

<!-- ##Installation
Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project. -->

<!-- ##API Reference
Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live. -->

<!-- ##Tests
